;   Exercise 4.34
;   =============
;   
;   Modify the driver loop for the evaluator so that lazy pairs and lists
;   will print in some reasonable way.  (What are you going to do about
;   infinite lists?) You may also need to modify the representation of lazy
;   pairs so that the evaluator can identify them in order to print them.
