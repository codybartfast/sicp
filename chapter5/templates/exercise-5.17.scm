;   Exercise 5.17
;   =============
;   
;   Extend the instruction tracing of exercise [5.16] so that before
;   printing an instruction, the simulator prints any labels that
;   immediately precede that instruction in the controller sequence.  Be
;   careful to do this in a way that does not interfere with instruction
;   counting (exercise [5.15]). You will have to make the simulator retain
;   the necessary label information.
