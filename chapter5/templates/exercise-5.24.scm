;   Exercise 5.24
;   =============
;   
;   Implement cond as a new basic special form without reducing it to if. 
;   You will have to construct a loop that tests the predicates of
;   successive cond clauses until you find one that is true, and then use
;   ev-sequence to evaluate the actions of the clause.
